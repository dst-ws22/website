# Course overview

Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. With visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

In the world of big data, data visualization tools and technologies are essential to analyze massive amounts of information and make data-driven decisions. Our culture is visual, including everything from art and advertisements to TV and movies, and our eyes are drawn to colors and patterns. Our interaction with data should reflect this reality.

Storytelling with Data teaches you the fundamentals of data visualization and how to communicate effectively with data. You'll discover the power of storytelling and the way to make data a pivotal point in your story. The lessons in this illuminative text are grounded in theory, but made accessible through numerous real-world examples—ready for immediate application to your next graph or presentation.

Storytelling is not an inherent skill, especially when it comes to data visualization, and the tools at our disposal don't make it any easier. This book demonstrates how to go beyond conventional tools to reach the root of your data, and how to use your data to create an engaging, informative, compelling story. Specifically, you'll learn how to:

Understand the importance of context and audience
Determine the appropriate type of graph for your situation
Recognize and eliminate the clutter clouding your information
Direct your audience's attention to the most important parts of your data
Think like a designer and utilize concepts of design in data visualization
Leverage the power of storytelling to help your message resonate with your audience
Together, the lessons in this book will help you turn your data into high impact visual stories that stick with your audience. Rid your world of ineffective graphs, one exploding 3D pie chart at a time. There is a story in your data—Storytelling with Data will give you the skills and power to tell it!
